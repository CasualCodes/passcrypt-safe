# 5.1   -   <> I/O and CRUD Review
                + After Integration, add a 'choose your data folder' functionality
                - CRUD Matters:
                    + Create Function will work theoretically for Login Screen
                    - Given that there are no changes to file handling (which i doubt), 
                        case 2 may not suffice anymore. We'll see
                    - Reminder: all user entry contents are currently stored in ONE encrypted file
                + Frontend adjustments for CRUD
                    + There will be adjustments for CRUD indicated by the todos
